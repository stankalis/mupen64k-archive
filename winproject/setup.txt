Mupen64++ is a MUltiple Platform Emulator for Nintendo64 that has
been extended from the original code with the purpose in mind to
keep development up to date.

[INFORMATION]

Mupen64++ comes with only four default plugins, these plugins have
been carefully selected, and although we could have bundled more
inside of the package size, agreements, and ease of use helped us
decide against this.

Please note that for the best experience one should run
the plugins specified in the comments (if any).

To add plugins in Mupen64++ please follow these steps:

[1] Close Mupen64++
[2] Open the plugin folder (defualt folder is 'plugin')
[3] Place files insides of folder
[4] Reopen Mupen64++
[5] Goto Settings (Options -> Settings or 'CTRL + S')
[6] Select the new plugin in the proper category.
[7] Click Ok

Please note that Jabo's plugins can only be found inside of the
Project64 (http://pj64-emu.com) package, however it is perfectly
okay to copy them over into Mupen64. A lot of Jabo's plugins work
on slower computers, so if you are experiencing a slow down try
switching plugins.

Before trying to play online or watching a video playback you will
need to set your ROM Directory, you can set it inside of
Settings -> Directories (Options -> Settings or 'CTRL + S' then 
navigate to the Directory tab).
